# qrates-eval

As part of my master's thesis, I gathered frequency data on calls made in all the crates on [crates.io](https://crates.io).
This repo provides this data, in gzipped form, as well as a collection of scripts that I used to gather it and a notebook picking it apart in various ways to glean insights.
All this was made possible by and centers around the [Qrates](https://github.com/rust-corpus/qrates) project.

The repository also contains some files detailing the current progress towards specifying these calls in the Prusti verifier through https://github.com/viperproject/prusti-dev/pull/1249.

If you found this, hopefully the data and/or the scripts can be useful to you!
